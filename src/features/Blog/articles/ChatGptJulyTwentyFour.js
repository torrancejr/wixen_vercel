                <p className="mt-6">
                    ChatGPT’s Voice Mode is an innovative feature that allows users to have real-time voice
                    conversations with ChatGPT. Leveraging the capabilities of the new GPT-4o model, this upgraded mode
                    is designed to deliver faster, more intuitive, and highly responsive interactions. Imagine
                    discussing project ideas, getting instant feedback, or even having the AI assist with real-time
                    tasks—all through natural conversation.
